Intro:

Since I'm looking for a job as a C# programmer, this application is my code refference
so that others can see how I code. If well or bad, someone else would have to tell me.

To develop the logic with a Real Life Tests on the CNC machine took about 3 days,
another week of carefull CNC milling and bug fixing, and about three to four weeks to 
finish the application to the look at which it is now.

So, let me know, what do you think about the C# code and let's hope that the first 
think I receive back would not be to ditch the comments :D

BTW: Those custom buttons with manualy coded graphics, yes thay could be loaded from
     a drawing and the whole process could be much much much faster, but where would be
     the fun and challenge by doing that :)

Test File:

In the "GCode Editor" folder there is a "Un-EditedG-CodeSample.tap" file, you can load
that file into the G-Code Editor and see how the application works.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fast Description:

The FormBorderStyle is turned off.

Only uploaded Graphics is the icon .ico, rest is hard coded (so much fun).

Custom Graphics is used on the Buttons, Panels and on the Main Form, driven by Event 
calls and not by Pain Overrides.

Async / Await is used for the Custom Progress Bar.

Main Form has a custom Resize Panels with Drag & Drop and an Autosave function, which 
saves application Location And Size (Settings.txt), which in case of a problem can be
simply deleted (new one will take its place).

About G-Code Editor:

This G-Code Editor was only created because Autodesk team working on Fusion 360 decided
to release an update to lower the speed for Non-Commercial Users (as a Hobby).

The incredible increase in machining time and the consumption of electricity was horrible
and so the idea to get around it was born !

When the G-Code file is loaded (this file has to come from Autodesk Fusion 360), 
G-Code Editor searches for those specific limiting lines (Highlighted in Red) and offers 
back a solution (Highlighted in Blue).

You can inspect the Original Code side and when you find a Red line that you want to see
in the Modified Code side, all you need to do is to click on that line.

What ever changes you do to the Original Code side won't effect the Modified Code side.
If you want to make manual changes (which is dangerous), just edit the lines in the
Modified Code side.

Save the file as .txt (for further file inspection) or .tap as an CNC Mach3 Input file.

Few G-Codes refferences are written under the Original Code Text Area, they are used 
for quick orientation. Just the most useful once are selected (useful for me, at least).

But, i have to warn you, this program was build by me alone and it was not intended for
anyone else. If by any chance Autodesk team decides to make an counter G-Code update
that would do who knows what, I might catch it months after the update. 
Because, you know, I'm a Hobby user (I'm not CNC milling every week).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Warning:

This program is very capable in making your CNC machine to make sudden and unexpected 
movements that might damage it, if not stopped by an "Emergency Stop" manually.

I have to say this, i will not be responsible for any damage you make by using this program,
wether the damage might be your health or property. And so, I do not recommend using it !
If something happens, you are responsible for your own actions (You have been warned !).

---------------------------

And that is all, I think..
Have a Great day :)
